naive_bayes 
treat probability event as a naive(단순한) event and test veriable type of data
, and choose the highest probability with bayes_theory

first input data to train and test
second. treat characteristics classifying  data as naive event (Vectorizing(text data to numeric data) all words)
third. test it

three type of naive bayes
first. Gaussian naive_bayes
ㄴif data is type of gausssian distribution(정규분포)
second. Bernoulli naive_bayes
ㄴif data is type of Bernooulli distribution(discrete type (0,1))
third. Multinomial naive_bayes
ㄴif data is type of Multinomial(다항분포:특정 사건이 독립일때 몇번 나타나는지)
