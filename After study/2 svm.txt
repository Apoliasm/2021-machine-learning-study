how to use support vector machine. 
1. load train data and test data so that my code separate which category is correct.
2. By using gridsearchSV, find optimal cost and gamma ( cost = how many use uncorrect data, gamma = vector's sensitive curve)
ㄴ2.1 . By making plot imported by matplotlib, show plot graph of each cost and gamma.
3. Use test data to check how much data can predict correctly,
ㄴstudy data's True/False positive/negative and data's accuracy,recall,precision and f1 score -> can find other type of average.
